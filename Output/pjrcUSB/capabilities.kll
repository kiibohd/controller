# After a USB HID packet is sent (Keyboard only), send another packet after n * 4 ms

## USB Compatibility Flags ##
# Some OSs and USB Chipsets have issues with USB features
# These flags are available to provide ways to debug them

# Enable USB Suspend/Low Power mode
# After a period of inactivity, the USB host may request that the device go into low power mode
# This is different than system sleep, though it may occur around the same time
enableUSBSuspend => enableUSBSuspend_define;
enableUSBSuspend = 1;

# Enable Low-power Negotiation
# In order to support low-powered USB hosts, such as an Apple IPad, a low power auto-negotiation scheme has been implemented
# Unfortunately, badly behaved USB Chipsets and OSs may not work correctly with this support enabled
# Typical symptoms:
# * USB constantly re-initializing when first plugging in
enableUSBLowPowerNegotiation => enableUSBLowPowerNegotiation_define;
enableUSBLowPowerNegotiation = 0;

# Enable Device Restart on USB Timeout
# *USE AS LAST RETORT*
# To work around some USB OS, Chipset and Firwmare bugs, an auto-restart mechanism has been implemented
# Depending on the situation, this can be rather aggressive.
# This behaves differently than the Low-power negotiation restart and have very different triggering schemes.
enableDeviceRestartOnUSBTimeout => enableDeviceRestartOnUSBTimeout_define;
enableDeviceRestartOnUSBTimeout = 0;

# Enable Host-Resume (wake-from-sleep)
# On specific actions (such as USB key actions), will trigger the host device to wake if USB is suspended
enableUSBResume => enableUSBResume_define;
enableUSBResume = 1;


## USB Endpoint Configuration ##
# 1 - Enable endpoint
# 0 - Disable endpoint
# Any/all endpoints can be disabled
# But you'll lose functionality for that feature
# Disabling endpoints will save RAM and Flash on the target MCU

# Joystick Endpoint
# *Currently Unused*
enableJoystick => enableJoystick_define;
enableJoystick = 0;

# Mouse Endpoint
enableMouse => enableMouse_define;
enableMouse = 1;

# Keyboard Endpoint
enableKeyboard => enableKeyboard_define;

# CDC / Serial Port Endpoint
enableVirtualSerialPort => enableVirtualSerialPort_define;
enableVirtualSerialPort = 0;

# Raw I/O Endpoint
enableRawIO => enableRawIO_define;
